Here’s a comprehensive, scientifically grounded overview of the herbal extracts you mentioned — Lavandula stoechas, Malva sylvestris, Althaea officinalis, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Ziziphus jujube, Cassia fistula, Viola odorata, and Terminalia chebula — focusing on mechanisms of action, benefits, precautions, doses, side effects, and references.

⚠️ Important medical disclaimer: Herbal extracts can interact with medications or have toxic effects at high doses. The information below is not prescribing medical advice. Always consult a healthcare professional before use.

🧪 1. Mechanisms of Action
🌿 Lavandula stoechas (Spanish/French lavender)
Contains terpenes, phenolics with antispasmodic, anti‑inflammatory, anxiolytic effects.

Suggested smooth muscle relaxation via calcium channel blockade (gut, respiratory) and mild sedation. 

🌿 Malva sylvestris (Common mallow)
Rich in mucilage → creates protective, soothing film on mucous membranes (demulcent).

Antioxidant + mild laxative action increasing gastrointestinal motility. 

🌿 Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow)
High mucilage content → demulcent, anti‑inflammatory, soothes cough and irritation.

Modulates immune response and supports mucosal protection. 

🌿 Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice)
Glycyrrhizin and flavonoids → anti‑inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory.

Augments cortisol effects; can alter steroid metabolism. 

🌿 Ziziphus jujube (Jujube)
Flavonoids and terpenoids → antioxidant, anti‑inflammatory, sedative effects; modulates immune and stress responses. 

🌿 Cassia fistula (Golden shower tree)
Contains anthraquinones, flavonoids, tannins → laxative, anti‑inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. 

🌿 Viola odorata (Sweet violet)
Phenolic compounds → anti‑inflammatory, antioxidant, expectorant, and soothing effects on respiratory mucosa. 

🌿 Terminalia chebula (Haritaki)
Rich in tannins and ellagic acid derivatives → antimicrobial, antioxidant, gastrointestinal motility modulators, may support immune and metabolic health. 

🌟 2. Benefits (Traditional & Scientific)
Plant	Primary Traditional/Reported Benefits
Lavandula stoechas	Relaxation, gut spasm relief, mild anxiety support. 
Malva sylvestris	Soothes coughs, constipation relief. 
Althaea officinalis	Cough, dry irritated throat, mucosal soothing. 
Glycyrrhiza glabra	Respiratory support, anti‑inflammatory, antioxidant. 
Ziziphus jujube	Stress, sleep support, immune modulation. 
Cassia fistula	Constipation, inflammation, oxidative stress reduction. 
Viola odorata	Respiratory soothing, cough relief. 
Terminalia chebula	Digestive regulation, antimicrobial and antioxidant. 
⚠️ 3. Precautions and Interactions
General
All herbs can interact with medications (e.g., antihypertensives, anticoagulants, steroids).

Pregnancy & breastfeeding: Use only under supervision.

Allergies: People with pollen or plant allergies may react.

Specific Notes
Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice): High doses may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, fluid retention due to mineralocorticoid‑like effects. 

Cassia fistula: Potent laxative; chronic overuse → diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance. 

Terminalia chebula: May affect bowel motility; caution with GI disorders.

💊 4. Suggested Traditional Doses (NOT clinical prescriptions)
These are general traditional/empirical ranges from herbal literature. Clinical validation and safety are not established.

Plant	Traditional Dose (Herbal/formulation context)
Althaea officinalis	0.5–5 g dried herbs in tea, 3× daily; syrup 2–8 mL/day. 
Terminalia chebula	5–7 g dried fruit powder/day in traditional Unani medicine. 
General extracts	Herbal syrups often standardized to 0.5–5 mL/day in cough formulas. 
⚠️ No standardized, clinically validated dosing exists for most combination herbal capsules/syrups.

🔴 5. Potential Side Effects
Common and usually mild if used traditionally and appropriately — but possible:

Gastrointestinal discomfort: nausea, diarrhea (esp. Cassia).

Allergic reactions: rash, itching.

Licorice-specific: edema, hypertension, low potassium. 

Herb‑drug interactions: especially if blood pressure meds, anticoagulants, steroids.

📚 6. Reference Books / Resources for Further Study
Below are authoritative sources you can consult for in‑depth herbal pharmacology (not direct links — these are standard references in medicinal plant sciences):

🌿 Herbal Pharmacology & Ethnobotany
“Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry” – Textbooks covering plant constituents and mechanisms.

“Herbal Medicine: Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects” (2nd edition) – edited by Benzie & Wachtel‑Galor.

“Medicinal Plants of the World” – Kintzios, E.

“Indian Medicinal Plants: A Compendium of 500 Species” – by P. K. Warrier (AYUSH).

“Unani Medicine Textbooks” – e.g., Qanun‑fi‑Tibb (Avicenna), region‑specific Unani pharmacopoeias.

📌 Summary
These herbal extracts often work via anti‑inflammatory, antioxidant, demulcent, spasmolytic, and immunomodulatory mechanisms. 

They are traditionally used for respiratory symptoms (cough, irritation), digestive support, calming/stress relief, and constipation relief.

Consult professionals before clinical use — especially in combination products.

If you want, I can also help you with a monograph style breakdown (like one page per herb) in more detail or translate doses into your preferred measurement system.
