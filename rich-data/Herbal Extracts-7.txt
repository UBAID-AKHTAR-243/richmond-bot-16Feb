Perfect! Here’s a comprehensive reference table for all 8 herbs — it summarizes mechanism, benefits, precautions, doses, and side effects in one glance. This is ideal for syrups or capsules formulations.

Herb	Mechanism of Action	Benefits	Precautions	Dose (Syrup / Capsule)	Side Effects
Lavandula stoechas	Terpenes/phenolics → smooth muscle relaxant, mild sedative (CNS modulation)	GI spasm relief, mild anxiety, respiratory relaxation	Allergy to Lamiaceae, caution with sedatives	Syrup: 2–5 mL 2–3×/day
Capsule: 50–100 mg/day	Mild sedation, nausea, skin irritation (rare)
Malva sylvestris	Mucilage → demulcent; antioxidant; mild laxative	Soothes throat, cough; mild constipation relief	Rare allergy	Syrup: 2–8 mL/day
Capsule: 200–400 mg/day	Mild diarrhea, bloating (rare)
Althaea officinalis	Mucilage → demulcent, anti-inflammatory; protects mucosa	Cough, sore throat; GI anti-inflammatory	May reduce absorption of oral meds if taken simultaneously	Syrup: 2–8 mL/day
Capsule: 300–500 mg/day	Very rare: GI upset
Glycyrrhiza glabra	Glycyrrhizin → anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory; mimics cortisol	Respiratory support, anti-inflammatory	Avoid in hypertension, kidney disease; interacts with diuretics, steroids, antihypertensives	Syrup: 2–5 mL 2–3×/day
Capsule: 100–300 mg/day	Hypertension, fluid retention, hypokalemia (high doses)
Ziziphus jujube	Flavonoids → antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, mild sedative	Stress/sleep support, immune modulation	Use cautiously in severe diabetes	Syrup: 2–5 mL/day
Capsule: 200–500 mg/day	Drowsiness, mild GI upset (rare)
Cassia fistula	Anthraquinones → laxative, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory; tannins → antimicrobial	Constipation relief, GI anti-inflammatory	Avoid chronic use; not recommended in pregnancy	Syrup: 2–5 mL/day (short-term)
Capsule: 100–300 mg/day	Diarrhea, abdominal cramps, electrolyte imbalance (if long-term)
Viola odorata	Phenolic compounds → anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, expectorant	Soothes cough, respiratory irritation; mild sedative	Rare allergy	Syrup: 2–5 mL/day
Capsule: 100–300 mg/day	Mild GI upset, headache (rare)
Terminalia chebula	Tannins/ellagic acids → antioxidant, antimicrobial, digestive tonic	Improves digestion, mild laxative, immune support	Avoid in severe diarrhea; caution in pregnancy	Syrup: 2–5 mL/day
Capsule: 300–500 mg/day	Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort (high doses)
This table allows a quick glance for formulation or clinical herbal use.

If you want, I can also suggest a ready-to-use combined syrup/capsule formulation with standardized extract ratios for all 8 herbs — this would be practical for product development.

Do you want me to prepare that?
