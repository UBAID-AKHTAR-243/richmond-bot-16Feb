I’ll give you (A) a practical herb–drug interaction checker, (B) product/formulation comparison guidance for syrup, and (C) key reference books. At the end, I’ll ask one short follow-up so I can tailor it exactly to your needs.

A) Herb–Drug Interaction Checker
(Ginkgo biloba extract + Panax ginseng extract)

1️⃣ Anticoagulants / Antiplatelets
Examples: Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Warfarin, Heparin
🔴 Risk: Increased bleeding tendency
Reason:

Ginkgo ↓ platelet aggregation

Ginseng may enhance anticoagulant effects
Advice:

Avoid combination OR monitor closely

Stop 7 days before surgery

2️⃣ Antihypertensive Drugs
Examples: Amlodipine, Losartan, Atenolol
🟠 Risk: Excess fall in blood pressure
Reason:

Both herbs improve vasodilation
Advice:

Monitor BP

Start with low dose syrup

3️⃣ Antidiabetic Drugs
Examples: Metformin, Glimepiride, Insulin
🟠 Risk: Hypoglycemia
Reason:

Ginseng improves insulin sensitivity
Advice:

Monitor fasting & post-meal glucose

4️⃣ CNS Drugs
Examples: Antidepressants, Antiepileptics
🟠 Risk:

Ginkgo → lowers seizure threshold (rare)

Ginseng → CNS stimulation
Advice:

Avoid in epilepsy

Use cautiously with SSRIs

5️⃣ Stimulants
Examples: Caffeine, Energy drinks
🟡 Risk: Palpitations, insomnia
Advice:

Avoid evening dosing

Reduce caffeine intake

B) Product / Syrup Formulation Comparison (Practical Guide)
✅ Ideal Standardization (Per 5 mL Syrup)
Component	Recommended
Ginkgo biloba extract	20–40 mg (24% flavone glycosides)
Panax ginseng extract	25–50 mg (≥5% ginsenosides)
Base	Sucrose or sugar-free (sucralose/stevia)
Preservative	Sodium benzoate / Potassium sorbate
Flavor	Peppermint / Orange
⚖️ Syrup vs Capsule
Parameter	Syrup	Capsule
Absorption	Faster	Moderate
Patient compliance	Better (elderly)	Better (long-term)
Dose flexibility	High	Fixed
Sugar concern	Yes	No
C) Dose & Best Time (Clinically Used Pattern)
📏 Dose
Adults:
👉 5 mL 2 times daily

Elderly / Weak patients:
👉 5 mL once daily initially

⏰ Best Time
Morning after breakfast

Afternoon after lunch
❌ Avoid night dose (may cause insomnia)

D) Major Side Effects to Monitor
Headache

Dizziness

Gastric irritation

Palpitations (high dose)

Sleep disturbance

➡️ Usually dose-related and reversible

E) Reference Books (Authoritative)
📚 Pharmacognosy & Herbal Medicine
Principles and Practice of Phytotherapy

Herbal Medicine: Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects

Pharmacognosy

📖 Evidence Databases
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database

WHO Monographs on Selected Medicinal Plants

F) Clinical Positioning (Marketing / Medical Use)
Best suited for:

Memory decline

Poor cerebral circulation

Mental fatigue

Age-related cognitive weakness

Stress-related exhaustion

🔹 Quick Question (so I can customize it fully):
Do you want this interaction checker for a specific patient, or for product registration / marketing (PAFDA / DRAP)?
If patient-based, please tell me which medicines they are taking.
