Great! Here’s a suggested combined formulation for a herbal syrup and capsule using all 8 herbs. I’ve based it on traditional doses, safety, and synergistic effects. This is for general reference / formulation planning — exact amounts should be adjusted after lab standardization and regulatory review.

1. Combined Herbal Syrup (100 mL Base)
Herb	Extract Type	Suggested Amount per 100 mL	Rationale
Lavandula stoechas	Hydroalcoholic / aqueous extract	1 g	Smooth muscle relaxant, mild sedative
Malva sylvestris	Aqueous extract	2 g	Demulcent, mucosal soothing
Althaea officinalis	Aqueous extract	2 g	Anti-inflammatory, cough relief
Glycyrrhiza glabra	Standardized extract (glycyrrhizin 10–20%)	0.5 g	Anti-inflammatory, respiratory support
Ziziphus jujube	Aqueous or hydroalcoholic extract	1 g	Mild sedative, stress support
Cassia fistula	Hydroalcoholic extract	0.5 g	Mild laxative, GI support
Viola odorata	Aqueous extract	0.5 g	Expectorant, respiratory soothing
Terminalia chebula	Powdered extract or hydroalcoholic extract	1 g	Digestive tonic, antioxidant
Syrup Base	-	qs 100 mL	Sugar or sugar-free base, e.g., sorbitol/glycerin or herbal syrup base
Suggested Dose (Syrup):

Adults: 5–10 mL, 2–3 times daily.

Children (6–12 yrs): 2–5 mL, 1–2 times daily.

Notes:

Can flavor with honey, menthol, or mild natural flavors.

Shelf-life: typically 6–12 months if preservative/stable base used.

2. Combined Capsule Formulation
Herb	Extract Type	Suggested Amount per Capsule (500 mg capsule)	Rationale
Lavandula stoechas	Standardized extract	50 mg	Mild relaxation, spasmolytic
Malva sylvestris	Aqueous extract	50 mg	Mucosal soothing
Althaea officinalis	Aqueous extract	50 mg	Demulcent, anti-inflammatory
Glycyrrhiza glabra	Standardized extract	50 mg	Anti-inflammatory, respiratory support
Ziziphus jujube	Hydroalcoholic extract	50 mg	Sedative, stress support
Cassia fistula	Hydroalcoholic extract	50 mg	Mild laxative
Viola odorata	Aqueous extract	50 mg	Expectorant, respiratory soothing
Terminalia chebula	Powdered/hydroalcoholic extract	100 mg	Digestive tonic, antioxidant
Excipients	-	qs 500 mg	Capsule filler (e.g., maltodextrin), capsule shell
Suggested Dose (Capsule):

Adults: 1–2 capsules 1–2 times daily, after meals.

Children: Consult pediatric herbalist; typically lower dose or syrup preferred.

Notes:

Standardization: Ensure Glycyrrhiza glabra is 10–20% glycyrrhizin.

Avoid prolonged use of Cassia fistula extract (laxative) beyond 1–2 weeks unless monitored.

⚠️ Safety & Precautions
Monitor blood pressure and electrolytes if using Glycyrrhiza glabra regularly.

Avoid in severe kidney or liver disease without supervision.

Short-term use for constipation (Cassia) is recommended; avoid chronic laxative use.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Only under professional guidance.

Allergies: Patch test or small dose trial if sensitive to any plant.

If you want, I can also draw a visual schematic showing all 8 herbs in the syrup/capsule with their roles and effects — like a formulation map — which is very useful for presentations or labels.

Do you want me to make that visual?
